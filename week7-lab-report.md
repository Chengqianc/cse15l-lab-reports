### Part 1

This is the start up view of Vim.

We entered in "/start" and pressed enter.

We entered in "ce", which changes to the end of the word.

We entered in "base", which adds the text "base" to where the cursor was.

After entering "Esc", we entered in "n".

We then entered in ".", which changes "start" to "base".

We entered in ".", which changes "start" to "base".

We entered in ":wq", which exits out Vim with all changes saved.

### Part 2
Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
I would want to just use Vim to edit the code on the remote server if it's a small change and ultimately I want the code change to be reflected on the remote server.

What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
If I have a ton of code and files to edit, I would want to use a code editor like VS Code.
